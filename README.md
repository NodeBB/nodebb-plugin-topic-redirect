# Topic Redirect Plugin for NodeBB

This plugin allows you to specify some topics as redirects to external assets. It is useful if migrating some topics away from NodeBB (and preserving the old link for SEO purposes).

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-topic-redirect

    ... or via the NodeBB plugins page in the ACP.
